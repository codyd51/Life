Life
-----------------

This is an iOS app demonstrating Conway's Game of Life. It is intended solely as a proof of concept, not as a production app.

Each game tick, we generate a game state from the observed grid cell states. For each cell in the state, we count its neighbors and update its state according to the game rules. Then, the board is set to the modified state.
